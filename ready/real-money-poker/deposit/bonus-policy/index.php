For example, if you contribute $25 of a $100 pot (25%) and a $4.00 rake is taken from the table, you contributed $1.00 of the rake (25%).</li> <li>playing poker tournaments - for every $1 spent on tournament fees you will earn 2 Bonus Points.</li> <li>playing casino games (from your poker account) – for every $10 wagered in the casino you will earn 1 Bonus Point.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Unless stated otherwise in the applicable Promotion Terms: (i) immediate (non-pending) bonuses (those bonus funds which are placed in your account balance that are awarded to you in a restricted state and may be wagered immediately upon grant) may only be withdrawn after a player has collected 2.5 Bonus Points for every $1 of the received bonus amount. For example, a player must accumulate 25 Bonus Points using Restricted Funds (as defined in point 13 below) before withdrawing a bonus totaling $10. When the applicable bonus point requirements have been met, the bonus and any winnings derived from the bonus will be available for withdrawal; and (ii) all pending bonuses (bonus funds awarded in a restricted state and which do not appear in your account that may not be accessed nor wagered with, but are released into a player’s real-money bankroll when all the applicable wagering requirements have been completed) may only be withdrawn after a player has collected 2.5 Bonus Points for every $1 of the received bonus amount.

When the applicable bonus point requirements have been met, the bonus and any winnings derived from the bonus will be available for withdrawal.</li> <li>Unless stated otherwise in the applicable Promotion Terms, all bonuses (and any associated winnings) expire within 30 days of the bonus being granted.
