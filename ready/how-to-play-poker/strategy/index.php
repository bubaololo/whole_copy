Poker is a game of timed, focused aggression. And as you master the basics of the game, you’ll learn when you need to up the aggression at the table.</p><p>Many novice players are simply too cautious, too much of the time. They will check when they should bet and call when they should raise. On solid <a href="/magazine/strategy/pre-flop-hand-strength">opening hands</a>, like high pairs or a hand made up of A-K or A-Q, you should play more aggressively than you might think you should. These are great cards to be starting out with a raise.</p><p>You’ll want to make sure that, in a game with a full table, you push players with weaker holdings out – or force them to – or force them to cough up to stay in. There’s nothing worse than underplaying a pair of Kings only to be beaten by someone who checked before the flop with 8-4 and miraculously caught a straight.</p><p>Make them pay to see those cards and push as many people out of the pot as early as possible. With six people in a pot, your base odds of a win are only 17%. With only two in the pot, that rockets up to 50%.</p><p>What’s worse with cautious play is that it marks you as a weaker player to the rest of the table. If you rarely bet or raise, you’ll soon find yourself being pushed around by stronger players who know you’ll cave under pressure. When you do bet big, other players will immediately know you hold a strong hand and everyone will quickly fold, reducing the amount you get paid off.</p><p>Remember that <a href="/magazine/strategy/mastering-fundamentals-texas-holdem/more-aggression-more-profit">aggressive play</a>&nbsp;builds big pots. If you have a winning hand, your best move is to milk the table for all you can get. This scenario spotlights poker at its most fun and most thrilling.</p></div> </div></div>                 <div class="image">           <div class="image-component img-100">       <div class="image-container js-modal-open modal-enabled">                               <picture>                  <img src="/assets/strategystep1-1658754949978_tcm1488-562695.jpg" width="1200" height="675" alt="strategystep1-1658754949978_tcm1488-562695" loading="lazy">     </picture>       </div>      <div class="image-caption">Aggression puts pressure on opponents and more often than not wins the post.</div>                  <div class="modal js-modal js-modal-close">                <div class="modal-dialog">                     <div class="modal-content js-modal-content">                          <button class="button-close js-modal-button" title="Close (Esc)" aria-label="Close (Esc)">×</button>                                              <picture>                  <img class="modal-image js-modal-image" src="/assets/strategystep1-1658754949978_tcm1488-562695.jpg" width="1200" height="675" alt="strategystep1-1658754949978_tcm1488-562695" loading="lazy">     </picture>                      </div>                </div>           </div>       </div> </div>                 <div class="rich-text">            <div class="rich-text-component">     <div class="text"><h2 id="tip2"><b>Poker Tip 2: …But You Must Also be Patient</b></h2> <p>Being aggressive doesn’t mean throwing money away on bad hands and going all-in on the hope of catching a great card on the river.

K-K is a fantastic hand, but if another player holds A-A, your kings are losers 82% of the time. Imagine the reverse situation: You hold A-10 while the other guy’s on J-J. The flop comes up 10-8-6.

One of them, especially in this day and age, is Game Theory Optimal (GTO) play. It’s an approach/strategy in which players try to play a perfect style rooted in balanced ranges and mathematical-based models.</p><p>The theory goes that if you properly execute a GTO style, you close yourself off from making mistakes, whereas your opponents will make some. In a heads-up match, if both players were to play a perfect GTO game, it’d simply boil down to luck as neither player would be making a mistake.</p><p>All that said, the sheer number of situations and card combinations make it extremely difficult for players to play a perfect GTO style. Many players aspire to it, but few are able to do it consistently on the real and virtual felts.</p><p>Even so, it’s critical to understand how it works as it’s prevalent in today’s game. By familiarizing yourself, you cannot only incorporate elements into your own game, but you can also be wise to a popular strategy employed by your opponents.</p><p><a href="/magazine/strategy/beginners-guide-gto-poker">Click here to learn more about GTO on 888poker.</a></p></div> </div></div>                 <div class="rich-text">            <div class="rich-text-component None None">     <div class="text"><h2 id="tip9"><strong>Poker Tip 9: Don’t Neglect Your Mental Game</strong></h2><p>Poker isn’t physically strenuous, but it can be extremely taxing to the mind. That’s why it’s imperative to pay close attention to the mental game of poker.</p><p>From controlling your emotions to avoiding distraction, your brain is tasked with dozens of things all at once in any given poker session.</p><p>Inevitably, you will experience frustration and tilt, which if left unchecked can sink your poker game faster than an iceberg to the Titanic. You need to learn how to declutter your mind, develop a positive mentality, and deal with losses.</p><p>It sounds easy, but it’s not. There are poker players out there who’ve played professionally for decades that still struggle with the mental side of the game.</p><p>The key takeaway is that while you learn poker and gain more experience, be sure not to neglect your own mental health.</p><p>If you do, the game can warp your thoughts and impede your decision-making ability, which will inescapably be detrimental to your chances of success.</p><p>For more on the mental game of poker, check out Jared Tendler’s '<a href="/magazine/poker-mental-strategy">Why Mind Matters” series right here on 888poker</a>.</p></div> </div></div>                 <div class="rich-text">            <div class="rich-text-component None None">     <div class="text"><h2><strong>Poker Strategy – Questions and Answers</strong></h2><br><p><strong>Question 1</strong>: Is there a strategy to poker?</p><p>Although luck will heavily affect the winner of any given poker hand, good poker players realise that there is strong strategic element to the game of poker. Players using good strategy can definitely expect to win more money in the long run than those making random decisions.</p><br><p><strong>Question 2</strong>: Does it matter which poker strategy we use?</p><p>Although luck plays a big factor in short term results, poker strategy is NOT irrelevant (as it might be in some other casino games such as slots). Over the long run, poker is predominantly a game of skill, meaning that the best players can expect to earn consistent profits.</p><br><p><strong>Question 3</strong>: How can I learn good poker strategy?</p><p>Rather than attempt to master the game on our own, it’s recommended to make use of the wealth of poker material available online. Training sites, training videos, strategy articles, forums and private coaching are all excellent ways to learn high-level poker strategy.</p><br><p><strong>Question 4</strong>: Is there an optimal poker strategy?</p><p>It’s theoretically possible to derive an optimal solution to poker using the branch of mathematics known as game theory. Unfortunately, most poker variants are complex enough that humans are still a considerable distance from knowing the theoretically optimal strategy.</p><br><p><strong>Question 5</strong>: What is the best strategy in poker?</p><p>The most profitable way to play poker is to make use of “exploitative” strategies. This concept involves probing our opponent’s game for weaknesses and look to target those weaknesses as aggressively as possible.</p></div> </div></div>                 <div class="rich-text">            <div class="rich-text-component None None">     <div class="text"><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Every player has had a bad session at the table.
