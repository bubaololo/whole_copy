A former teacher turned professional poker player, Ian has lived in the northeast of England his whole life. Geordie land has always been his home. But as he grew older, it was a career as a teacher that came calling and after university, that’s precisely the direction his life took. However, he won a satellite ticket to the Irish Open in 2012. That win delivered an even bigger ROI when he took fourth place for €107,500 ($141,623). He also won a last-longer challenge in the event, which landed him an additional €100,000. As part of the deal, he had to use half of that win to play live events. The poker tournament schedule and his teaching schedule clashed. Ian chose poker in hopes of returning to teaching in the future. The very next year, in 2013, he went back to the Irish Open and this time took top honours for €265,000 ($339,604). Ian has racked up 1,086,946 in total live earnings as of May 2022. With steady in-the-money finishes since 2016, he has proven himself to be a tenacious and extremely talented poker player.
